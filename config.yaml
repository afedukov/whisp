# Model Settings
# =============================================================================
model:
  # Default Whisper model to use for transcription
  # Options: turbo, large, large-v2, medium, small, base
  #   - turbo:    ~800MB, 8x faster than large, good accuracy, multilingual (recommended)
  #   - large:    ~3GB, best accuracy (latest v3), slower processing
  #   - large-v2: ~3GB, previous large version, slightly faster than v3
  #   - medium:   ~1.5GB, good balance of speed and accuracy
  #   - small:    ~466MB, fast but lower accuracy
  #   - base:     ~145MB, very fast, basic accuracy
  default: "turbo"

  # Compute type for CPU inference
  # Options: int8, float32
  #   - int8:    Faster, lower memory usage (recommended for CPU)
  #   - float32: Higher precision, more memory
  compute_type_cpu: "int8"

  # Compute type for GPU (CUDA) inference
  # Options: float16, float32, int8_float16
  #   - float16:      Best balance of speed and memory for GPU (recommended)
  #   - float32:      Higher precision, more VRAM usage
  #   - int8_float16: Fastest, lowest VRAM, slightly lower accuracy
  compute_type_gpu: "float16"

transcription:
  # Default language for transcription
  # Leave empty ("") for automatic language detection

  # Full list: https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages
  default_language: ""

  # Beam size for beam search decoding
  # Higher values = better accuracy but slower processing
  # Range: 1-10 (default: 5)
  #   - 1:  Fastest, greedy decoding
  #   - 5:  Good balance (recommended)
  #   - 10: Best accuracy, slowest
  beam_size: 5

  # Voice Activity Detection (VAD) - skip silence in audio
  # Speeds up transcription by ignoring silent parts
  # Set to false if you need to preserve timing information
  vad_filter: true

  # Minimum silence duration in milliseconds to be skipped by VAD
  # Lower values = more aggressive silence skipping
  # Range: 100-2000 (default: 500)

  # Audio channels (1=mono, 2=stereo) - mono recommended for speech
  channels: 1

  # Default recording device (pre-select microphone or show interactive menu)
  # Options:
  #   -1                      → Show interactive device selection menu
  #   "BlackHole 2ch"         → Auto-use device by exact name (recommended!)
  #   "BlackHole"             → Auto-use device by partial name match
  #   4                       → Auto-use device by index (unreliable, may change!)
  # To see available devices, run: python whisp.py record
  default_device: "BlackHole"

  # Show audio level meter during recording (requires more CPU)
  show_level_meter: true

  # Directory to save recordings (only used when keep_recording is true)
  # Empty = system temp directory (recordings will be deleted after transcription)
  # Path = save recordings with timestamp to this directory

  # Keep recording file after transcription
  # true = save with timestamp in save_dir, false = delete after transcription

    Task: Translate the following transcript of a spoken lecture from {source_language} to {target_language}.

    Context: The source text is an automated transcription (ASR) of a speech. It contains phonetic errors, 
    misheard words, and run-on sentences typical of spoken language.

    Instructions:
    1.  **Correct & Translate:** Translate the text into natural, fluent {target_language}. If you encounter 
        obvious transcription errors (words that sound similar but make no sense in context, e.g., "Militärgisse" 
        or "brille vor Angst"), reconstruct the intended meaning based on the context before translating.
    2.  **Style & Tone:** Maintain the speaker's rhetorical style (storytelling, engaging, slightly informal 
        but educational). Avoid word-for-word translation. Rephrase sentences to sound natural in {target_language}, 
        as if a native speaker were giving the lecture.
    3.  **Structure:** Organize the text into logical paragraphs to improve readability. Fix punctuation where 
        the transcript is messy.
    4.  **Accuracy:** Preserve all names (George Bush, Al Gore, Pat Buchanan), dates, and numbers exactly.
    5.  **Output:** Provide ONLY the translated text, nothing else.

    Text to translate:
    {text}
